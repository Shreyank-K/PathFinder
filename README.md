# PathFinder
A path finding application developed for my discreet mathematics class.

Note: the UI for this application was developed using PySimpleGUI. Although it is free to use, you must sign up for an account to use or code with it. A temporary license is given to you that way.

Basic First-time Install
PySimpleGUI is installed using Python's pip command. If you're using the standard tkinter port (the default port) then you can install PySimpleGUI by typing:

```
python -m pip install PySimpleGUI
```
Instructions for installing the other ports is provided on the port's specific page in the Ports section.

These ports require the use of 3rd party packages and thus have some additional steps and licensing considerations for you to keep in mind.

Linux Installs
Because PySimpleGUI creates several executables that are invoked from the command line, these need to be on your path. The psgmain & psghome are examples of the PySimpleGUI built-in command line utilities that are installed. This often means you'll need to use sudo so that the install happens at the system rather than user level:

```
sudo python3 -m pip install PySimpleGUI
```
